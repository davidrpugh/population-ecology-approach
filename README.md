# Background

Our basic aim is to explain how the competition between two alleles can be influenced by the relative propensity for the bearer to be selected as a mate in preference to the bearer of a rival allele. The selection effect on equilibrium allele frequencies may outweigh the impact of alleleÃÅs intrinsic effect on fecundity.

What interests us in this model is that the strength of the sexual selection component is itself the outcome of natural selection. In other words, we suppose that mate preferences are themselves determined by alleles subject to selection.

We extend this idea to explain the selection of alleles favouring cooperation within groups due to evolution of a preference on the part of the groups for members displaying cooperative behaviour. This extends, in effect, the mechanism of sexual selection beyond the pairwise mating structure standard in this literature.

We start with a simple model that illustrates the coevolution of the allele determining selection and the allele determining behaviour. We call call the two forms of behaviour "cooperation" and "selfishness" in anticipation of the later extension. For now, "cooperation" means simply greater fecundity than "selfish" behaviour. We could perhaps at this stage label these "green" and "red". "Green" can but does not necessarily have to have a higher payoff (fecundity) than red. We show that even if "green" has higher fecundity, depending on other parameters equilibria may exist where "green" is driven to zero frequency.
